Overview of MACRO program and how to become a member
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

The MD/PhD Association for Clinical Research Outcomes was formed in the Fall of 2018 by Cameron Adams and Dayne Filer, when as students on the wards, they began to question current clinical practices and sought to form a sphere that promoted this type of clinical questioning and research. Recently (Fall 2022), the program has been revitalized by Nick Brazeau and Cameron Adams to continue with this initiative that was disrupted by PhD responsibilities, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other duties.  


In our minds, there are two different phases in the MD/PhD training: (1) learning how to ask important questions (particularly important during early training when it is easier to question everything!); (2) learning how to conduct clinical and translational research independently. We would argue that the first phase is primarily geared towards younger students, while the second phase is critical for students that are nearing the end of their basic science PhD and want to apply their skills in a translational way. However, despite having strong science skills, many may lack fundamental clinical research skills (e.g. epidemiology/biostatistics, computation/coding, study design, etc.).
